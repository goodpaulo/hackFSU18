Space Haste the final frontier of android games...

## Inspiration
We wanted to build an Android app and after attending a Unity workshop we were inspired to create a mobile game. We tried to turn our love for science fiction into a small game, but considering it was the first mobile app we've tried to make it proved to be quite the challenge.

## What it does
Space Haste is an Android app game where the user is flying a spaceship through space. The user gains points by collecting their alien allies, but loses if their ship gets hit by an asteroid. The user controls the spaceship by tapping left or right on the phone screen to move the spaceship left or right respectively.

## How we built it
First, we created the game in Unity using the programming language C#. We then connected our game with Android-Studio to demo it on an Android mobile device.

## Challenges we ran into
Our biggest challenge was deciding what project we wanted to tackle for this hackathon. We also faced a hurdle when we were trying to create the move left and move right buttons controlled by user touch.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Neither of us has ever used Android-Studio or built a mobile application before, so completing this project was our biggest accomplishment!

## What we learned
We learned how to create a mobile application through Unity as well as how to use Android-Studio.

## What's next for Space Haste
We hope to expand the game into levels and make it into a story as the user goes along. Furthermore, we hope to add more characters, special effects/music, and create a health bar for the user to increases difficulty.
